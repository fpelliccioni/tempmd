# Abstract

Knuth envisions bringing Bitcoin Cash to everyday life. We plan to do so by building a scalable monetary platform that offers one service: decentralized uncensored electronic cash. We are convinced the path best suited for that are simple and lean structures. Knuth stands firmly with that perspective recognizing in accessibility the most powerful option for every inhabitant of the network.

We also want to pave the way for newcomers. We want to help a new generation of developers to create amazing solutions, to take cross-borders trade to unprecedented levels.

In a nutshell, Knuth is a full-node implementation focused on extra performance and flexibility. It is designed for wallets, exchanges, block explorers, and miners. It is characterized by its modular architecture and beautiful code. But Knuth is also a development platform that offers a set of libraries as a foundation for building applications.

We think every Bitcoin Cash implementation to be successful must go through three important steps: following, mining, proposing. And we are totally committed to the task.

With a budget for this campaign limited and a deliverable package flexible at contributors' discretion, let there be no confusion! Our commitment to Bitcoin Cash is present and stronger than ever. Knuth plants its flag against any hostile force, internal or external, that even attempts to undermine the initiative of bringing electronic cash to the world.

Our policy is transparency, our process momentum, our culture competition. The challenge to take Bitcoin Cash to its maximum potential is now. Get ready.
